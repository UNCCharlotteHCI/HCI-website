        <p>Tangible interaction is a branch of HCI research that explores how to interact with digital information using physical objects and gesture-based interaction. While many tangible systems have been developed and evaluated, few people are doing fine-grained studies that investigate how tangible interaction affects specific aspects of human cognition. We are currently researching ways tangible interaction supports and affects creativity, specifically exploring tangible interaction for visual, musical, and language-based composition.
