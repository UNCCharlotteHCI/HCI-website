        <p>Crowdsourcing design has been applied in various areas of graphic design, software design, and product design. NatureNet draws on those experiences and research in diversity, creativity, and motivation to present a model for crowdsourcing the design of a socio-technical system for a citizen science community. NatureNet is a tabletop device with several client applications available in a nature park setting. Park visitors are encouraged to participate in the design of the tasks and the interaction design as well as collect bio-diversity data. Crowdsourcing design for citizen science of this kind serves two purposes: to increase the motivation to participate and to increase creativity through diversity of design expertise.
