        <p>We are exploring the factors that affect student learning online and face-to-face. We have currently studied this in a laboratory setting as well as an actual classroom setting. Our initial findings from this line of work is that students generally prefer working in groups when the work does not have a significant impact on their grades. We also observed a performance benefit for students the are learning in face-to-face groups when compared to working alone; however, this benefit doesnâ€™t appear to translate as readily to online group-based learning.
