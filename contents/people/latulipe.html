            I teach and engage in research in the field of Human-Computer Interaction at UNC Charlotte. My research involves developing and evaluating novel interaction techniques, creativity support tools and technologies to support the arts. Beyond technology and art, I am also interested in politics, gender issues, philosophy, behavioral economics, neuroscience, psychology and sociology.
